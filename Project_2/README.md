# CONCLUSION
- We should use collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users instead of content-based filtering. As collaborative filtering can find hidden patterns in the data and recommend movies to users based on their past behavior while content-based filtering can only recommend movies based on the assigned features. This requires users to manually search keyword based on their preferences.

- Personally, I would suggest using the model SVD from Surprise. As using anything from PySpark would require a lot of resources and time. The SVD model is easy to use and gives good results.
