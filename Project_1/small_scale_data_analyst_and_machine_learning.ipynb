    "- Customer Activity: Most customers exhibit low recency values, indicating high activity levels and strong customer retention. This suggests the company has a robust retention strategy, reducing churn among high-value customers.\n",
    "- Purchase Frequency: Customer purchase frequency is relatively low, implying long intervals between purchases. To boost revenue, the company should focus on enhancing the customer experience to encourage more frequent purchases. This strategy leverages existing customer relationships, which is more cost-effective and less risky than acquiring new customers or increasing prices.\n",
    "- Monetary Value: The monetary value distribution follows a normal bell curve with a slight left skew, indicating that most customers spend around $50 during the research period.\n",
    "- Data Correlation: The variables exhibit low correlation, indicating data independence. This is advantageous for regression modeling as it ensures the model can more accurately capture relationships between variables. However, for customer segmentation, a simple rule-based approach will be used instead of a regression model."

    "- VIP Customers: These highly valuable customers exhibit high activity, purchase frequency, and spending. This segment comprises 179 customers (4.6% of the total 3,898 customers) and contributes 10% of the total spending. The company should focus on retaining these customers through personalized services and offers. While offering more personalized services is manageable given their small number, it is crucial to avoid over-servicing, which could reduce profitability. Since 10% is not a considerable part of the customer base, providing more personalized services is reasonable, but excessive exclusive privileges should be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Main Customer Segments: Big spenders and average customers form the core of the companyâ€™s revenue, contributing 32.2% and 22.2% respectively. The company should focus on retaining these customers through excellent customer service and sales events. Implementing a loyalty program could encourage repeat purchases. Personalized services should be avoided due to the large number of customers in these segments, as such campaigns could become prohibitively expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At Risk, Hibernating, and Lost Customers: These segments, accounting for 20.48% of the customer base, are at risk of churning. The company should focus on re-engaging these customers with personalized offers and incentives, as well as implementing a win-back campaign to encourage their return. Also, a customer feedback system could help understand the reasons behind their potential departure and identify retention strategies. Although these customers are not significant spenders, a win-back campaign could still prove beneficial in retaining some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- New Customers: Comprising only 2.8% of the customer base, the number of new customers is relatively low. The company faces a choice between focusing on retaining and enhancing the efficiency of existing customers or developing new ones. This decision should be based on the financial situation. If revenue is declining, a win-back strategy is advisable, as get new customers is costlier and less likely to result in long-term retention. If revenue is growing, the company might consider focusing on get new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Product Insights\n",
    "- Most Popular Products: The top-selling products are beef, tropical fruit, and napkins, with tropical fruit being the most trending, contributing 5.25% of sales in the last month. The company should focus on promoting these products to boost sales. Consider bundling these products to encourage customers to purchase more items together. Implementing a loyalty program could further incentivize repeat purchases of these popular products. Additionally, a customer feedback system could provide insights into the reasons behind the popularity of these products and help identify further promotional opportunities."

The analysis highlight that the company should focus on retaining and enhancing the efficiency of existing customers.\n",

The KMeans clustering model with k=5 was selected as the best-performing model. The clustering results provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies. Both models suggest that the most recent customers, who visit the shop from the nearest 100 days, are the most valuable, consistent with the analysis from the customer segmentation."
